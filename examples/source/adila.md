### Experience {#experience}

Apple Product Design
: *Data Scientist and Visualization Engineer*
  __February 2012 - Current__

  Created simulations and visualizations that enabled rapid understanding of difficult concepts and instant identification of core issues. This involved writing various scripts and building reusable tools that continue to be used throughout the company. Wrote accompanying in-depth documentation and created various examples to help make these tools easy to understand and use.

  Architected and developed visualizations for viewing and monitoring manufacturing data in real-time.

  Optimized existing algorithms (both vendor-created and in-house) for speed. 

  Performed validation of vendor algorithms to ensure correctness and validate performance claims.

  Wrote algorithms simulating various different design decisions to ensure the optimum design was chosen. 

  Revamped an exiting product quality monitoring tool to improve usability and speed, as well as to permit more in-depth analysis of issues.


Open Source Statistics Library
: *Papaya*
  __January 2012__

  Created and maintained the open-source [papaya](http://adilapapaya.com/papayastatistics/) library -- a collection of statistics, mathematics, and matrix manipulation related utilities -- for the [Processing](https://processing.org) programming environment. 
 

Apple Industrial Design
: *Data Analyst Intern*
  __May - Aug 2011__

  Analyzed and visualized data specific to an at-the-time unreleased project with the help of various software platforms (primarily Matlab, Processing, Adobe Illustrator).

University of California at Berkeley
: *Research Assistant*
  __2007-2011__

  Helped develop and improve upon a model of the lumbar spine (models viewable at [simtk.org/home/lumbarspine](http://simtk.org/home/lumbarspine) and [simtk.org/home/spinebushing](http://simtk.org/home/spinebushing)).

  Wrote algorithms to aid with data acquisition and interpretation of experimental data sets obtained from in-vitro testing of lumbar specimens. Ran extensive error analysis on the resulting data.

  Published articles in peer-reviewed journals on [a musculoskeletal model of the lumbar spine](https://simtk.org/home/lumbarspine), [the dynamics of the intervertebral disc](https://simtk.org/home/spinebushing/), [Cartesian stiffness matrices](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11044-010-9205-z), [error analysis of experimentally obtained data sets](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.05.034), [quantification of rigid body motion using quaternions](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijengsci.2008.12.008), and [plant growth dynamics](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2008.06.005).

University of California at Berkeley
: *Graduate Student Instructor*
  __Fall 2007 & 2008, Spring 2009__
  
  Led discussion lectures and help sessions for Intermediate Dynamics (2 semesters) and Introductory Dynamics (1 semester).

  Awarded the <span class='em'>"Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award"</span>, 2008-2009 school year.
